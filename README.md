# Netlas
World atlas network connection visualizer. 

### TODO
   * Find an API that can handle a higher volume of requests
   * Create GUI:
      * Atlas
      * Connection Animations
   * New connections input as stream?
   * Dark Mode
   * Accurate Auto-Scrolling, currently scrolls but not to the bottom.
