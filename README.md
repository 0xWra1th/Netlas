World atlas network connection visualizer. 

### TODO
   * Find an API that can handle a higher volume of requests
   * Create GUI:
      * ~~Atlas~~
      * Connection Animations
      * Add more countries to the Atlas
   * New connections input as stream?
   * ~~Dark Mode~~
   * ~~Accurate Auto-Scrolling, currently scrolls but not to the bottom.~~
